# Coverage & reliability — what we actually have

What's **live in the dataset** today, how it was obtained, and **how much to trust it**. This is
the "things we DO have" companion to [provinces.md](provinces.md) (feasibility for the rest),
[outreach.md](outreach.md) (who to ask), and [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) (the plan).

> Reliability is the easy thing to forget: every province shows the same green **V** / red **T**,
> but one is read from exact per-member counts and another is *inferred* from parsed free text.
> The column below says which.

## Status van de bronnen

"Live" in the table below means *we have a working adapter and a dataset*. Whether the source still
answers is a separate question, and one that bit us: between 2026-06 and 2026-09 three sources broke
without anyone noticing, because the collector caught every failure, marked the scope
`available: false`, and still exited 0 — so the weekly Action stayed green while five of the nine
provinces quietly disappeared from the site. Fixed 2026-09-04 (see below).

| Source | Status | Since | Cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Utrecht** (GO) | ✅ fixed 2026-09-05 | broke 2026-07-16 run | The portal's `/Samenstelling/{fractie}/votings` route answered HTTP 200 with an **Anubis** anti-bot interstitial instead of JSON (a vendor-wide "botstopper" rolled out that summer, not aimed at us). The griffie forwarded the ask and GemeenteOplossingen added an exception for the collector's User-Agent within a day — see [outreach.md §4](outreach.md). No stemmingen took place during the outage, so no data was lost. |
| **Zuid-Holland, Fryslân, Gelderland, Overijssel** (Notubiz) | ✅ **refreshed locally** | CI blocked since 2026-06-18 | From GitHub's cloud runners, TCP to `api.notubiz.nl:443` is silently dropped and the Cloudflare portal returns 403 (diagnosed 2026-09-13). Notubiz confirmed a GEO-IP block and makes **no exceptions** (outreach.md §5); a home connection in Thailand works fine. So a **Windows scheduled task on the maintainer's PC** (`collector/refresh-notubiz.ps1`, Thursday 15:00, catches up after a missed start) collects just these four and pushes only their data files. The CI run still logs KNOWN ISSUE for them each week. That is expected, and the site shows the notice only if their data passes `NOTICE_AFTER_DAYS` (14). If the local task stops, CI turns red after 45 days. Log: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wie-stemde-wat\refresh-notubiz.log`. |
| **Europees Parlement** (HowTheyVote.eu) | ✅ fixed 2026-09-04 | broke 2026-07-23 | The API began rate-limiting; the 8-worker detail fetch got throttled and `ep_assemble_*` silently dropped every vote whose detail was missing. The 2024–2029 scope shrank from 614 stemmingen to **95**, and 2019–2024 from 1807 to **130**, without ever being marked unavailable. Now: retry on 429/5xx with Retry-After, 4 workers, and a sequential repair pass. |

| **Noord-Holland, Limburg, Noord-Brabant** (iBabs) | ✅ fixed 2026-10-01 | broke 2026-10-01 run | iBabs began **capping a report page at 100 rows**. The collector asked for everything in one request (`length=2000`), which had always worked, so each report silently returned just the newest 100 (Limburg moties 1622 → 100) and the three provinces lost two thirds of their stemmingen in one run: NH 199→143, Limburg 356→158, NB 645→159. No request failed and the output looked perfectly plausible — **the first regression the guard caught in the wild**, and before September it would have overwritten the good files and gone green. The endpoint still honours `start` and reports the real total, so `ibabs_rows()` now pages through 100 at a time. |

**How this is caught now.** `collect.py` records why requests failed (HTTP status, or "anti-bot
interstitial, not JSON"), and compares each scope against what the last good run produced
(`previous_state()`). If a live scope returns nothing — or loses more than `max(5, 2%)` of its
stemmingen (`lost_data()`) — the collector:

1. **keeps the previous data file** rather than overwriting or hiding it, so the scope stays on the
   site with its real "bijgewerkt" date visible instead of vanishing;
2. prints a `REGRESSION:` line naming the scope and the failed requests;
3. **exits 1**, so the weekly Action fails and GitHub emails about it.

That last point is the actual fix. Everything else was already visible in the logs — nobody was
reading them, because nothing ever asked them to.

**Acknowledged breakages.** A source we already know about carries a `known_issue` note in its
`SOURCES` entry. It still prints its failure and still keeps its last good data, but it does **not**
turn the run red — otherwise the workflow would be red every week for the same five scopes, and a
permanently red workflow trains you to ignore it, which is the failure above wearing a different
hat. Red therefore means *something new broke*. Two things keep an acknowledgement from rotting:

- **A staleness ceiling.** Past `STALE_AFTER_DAYS` (45) the scope goes red anyway, acknowledged or
  not. An acknowledgement buys time, not silence.
- **It is visible to visitors.** The note travels into `catalog.json` as `knownIssue` and the page
  shows it above the table — "bijgewerkt 9 juli 2026" on its own does not tell someone that a date
  is a fault rather than a quiet month, and on an open-data site that is the wrong side to err on.

The marker is only written while a scope is actually serving data the collector could not refresh,
so it clears itself the moment the source works again (and the run prints a reminder to delete the
now-pointless `known_issue` key).

(Counts as of the last refresh; the weekly Action keeps them current. The table shows the **current**
term of each national/EU body; **previous terms** are live too — see *Historische termijnen* below.)

## Historische termijnen (Tweede Kamer, Eerste Kamer, Europees Parlement)

Each national/EU body now keeps **one scope per parliamentary term**, selectable in the frontend
("Kies een periode"). The collector slices each body's full history by `term_bounds` = `[term_start,
term_end)`; the current term leaves `term_end` open. This covers the coronaperiode (2020–2021) for all
three bodies — the votes on the coronawet, avondklok, steunpakketten, toeslagenaffaire, etc.

| Body | Termijn | Vendor | Items | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tweede Kamer** | 2023–2025 (Schoof) | TK OData | 7 903 | A | |
| **Tweede Kamer** | 2021–2023 (Rutte IV) | TK OData | 11 254 | A | |
| **Tweede Kamer** | 2017–2021 (Rutte III · corona) | TK OData | 14 178 | A | |
| **Tweede Kamer** | 2012–2017 (Rutte II) | TK OData | 13 826 | A | |
| **Tweede Kamer** | 2010–2012 (Rutte I) | TK OData | 6 090 | A | |
| **Tweede Kamer** | 2006–2010 (Balkenende IV) | TK OData | 4 561 | A | **vanaf 2008** — OData's roll-call floor (niets ervoor) |
| **Eerste Kamer** | 2019–2023 (corona) | eerstekamer.nl | 638 | B | |
| **Eerste Kamer** | 2015–2019 | eerstekamer.nl | 354 | B | |
| **Europees Parlement** | 2019–2024 (corona) | HowTheyVote.eu | 1 807 | A | both views (Europese fracties + Nederlandse afvaardiging) |

~60 000 extra stemmingen. Tiers match each body's current term (TK/EP tier A exact, EK tier B
faction-level). **Source limits found while building this:**
- **TK floor is 2008** — the OData `Stemming` data has a hard cliff; nothing is published before 2008
  (so the 2006–2010 Kamer is covered only from 2008 on).
- **EK reaches back to ~mid-2015 only** — the "stemmingen per vergaderdag" archive's *eerdere
  stemmingen* chain ends there (probed: 145 pages), so the 2011 and 2007 EK terms aren't served as
  data and aren't advertised.
- **EP floor is 2019-07** — HowTheyVote only holds the 9th term onward; there is no pre-2019 EP data.
- **EP Nederlandse afvaardiging — historical map built (2026-07-08).** The by-national-party view needs
  a per-term MEP→partij map (a person's national party can differ per term). `EP_NL_PARTY_T9` for the 9th
  term was resolved from **EP Open Data** (each MEP's `NATIONAL_POLITICAL_GROUP` membership dated to the
  term; longest-overlapping party wins for mid-term switchers) — 33 NL MEPs, 10 parties, with **GroenLinks
  and PvdA separate** (pre-2023-merger). `ep_nl_config(term_start)` picks the right map. One MEP excluded:
  **Dorien Rookmaker** (elected FvD, left 2021, sat as a non-party independent for most of the term).

**Large terms are chunked.** A multi-year TK term is ~14 MB, which is too big to load as one file, so
`write_scope` splits any scope > 5 000 stemmingen into **per-year files + a small manifest**
(`{key}.{year}.json` + `{key}.json`). The frontend loads the newest year first (fast first paint,
~0.8 MB), streams the rest in the background, and offers a **"Periode" (jaar) filter** that caps the
rendered table to one year while the analyses still use the whole loaded term. Weekly reruns only
rewrite the current year's file (no multi-MB git churn). Small scopes stay a single JSON as before.

## Reliability tiers

How directly the published data maps to what we display, and how much we infer.

- **A — exact (structured source).** The source gives the vote itself as structured data; we
  normalize, we don't interpret. Exact counts and real split votes; minimal inference.
  *Tweede Kamer* (OData `Stemming` — per-fractie `Soort` + `FractieGrootte` seat counts),
  *Europees Parlement* (HowTheyVote.eu `stats.by_group` — exact per-group MEP counts FOR/AGAINST/
  ABSTENTION; a group split across FOR/AGAINST is a real split), *Utrecht* and *Drenthe* (GO JSON,
  per-member tallies), *Limburg* and *Noord-Brabant* (iBabs "Stemmen" field — per-fractie member counts for the voor/tegen sides) and
  the **four Notubiz provinces** (*Zuid-Holland, Fryslân, Gelderland, Overijssel* — the portal lists
  every member's own voor/tegen vote, so counts and intra-fractie splits are exact).
- **B — parsed / inferred (semi-structured source).** The outcome is published, but as text/HTML we
  must parse, and (for NH) part of the result is *computed* rather than stated. Correct for "which
  fractie voted voor/tegen" on the items present, with the caveats below. *Noord-Holland* (iBabs
  "Stemverhouding" — one side named + "overige fracties" inferred) and *Eerste Kamer* (eerstekamer.nl
  HTML — **both** sides named, so nothing inferred, but no seat counts). Both are faction-level V/T.
- **C — derived / unavailable (not implemented).** Votes exist only as **unstructured PDF prose**, not
  machine-readable. This is where **Groningen** (Notubiz Handelingen — both sides + totals), **Zeeland**
  (iBabs concept-besluitenlijst — voting fracties named) and **Flevoland** (GO besluitenlijsten) sit today
  — the votes *are* published, just not as data (probed 2026-07-05/06). Drenthe was here too until
  2026-07-05, when its structured votes surfaced at the `/Leden/...` path → now tier A; **Noord-Brabant**
  was here too until 2026-07-06, when its per-fractie votes turned out to be in the iBabs `Stemmen` field
  all along (mis-filed as notulen-only) → now tier A. Parsing the remaining PDFs is possible (Zeeland
  NH-style tier B; Groningen richer but verbatim) yet fragile/per-province, so it's deprioritized in favour
  of the publish-as-data lobby. The Notubiz `role_id → fractie` API map *is* auth-gated, but it turned out
  we don't need it — the four live Notubiz portals already name the fractie + members (tier A; §11).
  **Nothing in the shipped dataset is tier C** — tier C describes the three not-yet-collected provinces.

## Per-scope caveats (what could be wrong, and why)

### Tweede Kamer — tier A
- Votes come straight from the OData `Stemming` entity: per fractie a `Soort` (Voor/Tegen/Niet
  deelgenomen) and `FractieGrootte` (seat count). Exact tallies, self-contained per besluit — nothing
  inferred (unlike NH). Includes **verworpen**. We keep only besluiten with an actual roll-call
  (`Stemming/any()`), so items decided *zonder stemming* / aangehouden / ingetrokken drop out.
- **Three vote shapes, one counting rule** (verified — each besluit's seats sum to ≤150):
  a *block* vote = one row per fractie (use `FractieGrootte`); a *hoofdelijke* stemming = one row
  **per member** (each carries the full fractie size — count 1 per row, not the size); *block +
  aantekening* = a block row plus per-member rows for deviating members (count the members as 1 and
  subtract them from the block, so they aren't double-counted). A fractie whose members split on a
  hoofdelijke vote correctly shows a real split (V + dot, or O).
- **Rare upstream inconsistencies.** The official `BesluitSoort` is the source of truth for the
  outcome and we mirror it; on ~1 item in ~3,000 it disagrees with the seat tally (e.g. a motie
  marked *aangenomen* that tallies 71–79). We don't "correct" the source — the per-fractie positions
  are still shown verbatim. 75–75 ties recorded as *verworpen* are genuine, not errors.
- **Term scope:** one scope **per Kamer**, back to 2008 (OData's floor). Each is date-bounded to
  `[installatie, installatie van de volgende Kamer)` so fractie sizes stay consistent within a term.
  The current term is votes on/after 2025-11-13. See *Historische termijnen* above for the full list.
- **Mid-term composition:** `ActorFractie` is the name *at vote time*. We merge the pure rename
  GroenLinks-PvdA → "Progressief Nederland" into one column; splinters (Groep Markuszower, Keijzer)
  are their own columns — accurate, if visually busier. `Persoon_Id`-level (hoofdelijke) votes aren't
  split out; we aggregate to the fractie.
- **Volume:** the current term is ~2,945 stemmingen (~3 MB minified, single file). The **previous
  terms are much larger** — a 4-year term is ~14 k stemmingen / ~14 MB — so any scope > 5 000 items is
  written as **per-year chunk files + a manifest** and the frontend loads the newest year first, streams
  the rest, and caps the table via the "Periode" filter (see *Historische termijnen*). This is the
  pagination/virtualization the single-file note used to flag.

### Europees Parlement — tier A (exact per-group counts)
The unit is the **European political group** (EPP, S&D, PfE, ECR, Renew, Greens/EFA, The Left, ESN,
NI), not individual MEPs or Dutch MEPs only. Source: HowTheyVote.eu `stats.by_group` (see
[data-sources.md](data-sources.md) §10), which compiles the EP's official roll-call open data.
1. **Exact counts.** Each group's FOR/AGAINST/ABSTENTION MEP counts are given verbatim, so tallies and
   intra-group splits (a group voting partly FOR, partly AGAINST) are real — `granularity: "member"`.
2. **Roll-call votes only.** Only votes taken by roll call are recorded per-MEP; show-of-hands votes
   aren't published per group anywhere (inherent to the EP, like every source here). We keep only the
   **`is_main`** (final) votes per file — amendment/procedural sub-votes are excluded.
3. **Group at vote time.** `stats.by_group` reflects each MEP's group on the vote date, so a mid-term
   group switch is handled upstream — no inference on our side.
4. **Term:** current (10th) EP, votes on/after 2024-07-16 (differs from the TK and EK terms), plus the
   **9th term (2019–2024)** as a previous-period scope — **both** views (Europese fracties + Nederlandse
   afvaardiging; the 9th-term NL map is built from EP Open Data, see *Historische termijnen*).
   HowTheyVote's floor is 2019-07, so there is no earlier EP data. Includes **verworpen**.
5. **Licence/attribution:** HowTheyVote.eu data is ODbL; `meta.license` credits HowTheyVote.eu + the
   European Parliament.
6. **Two views (scopes).** *Europese fracties* (by Euro-group) and *Nederlandse afvaardiging* (the 31
   NL MEPs grouped by **national party** — PVV, GL-PvdA, VVD, …, with exact MEP counts + an MEP roster
   per party in the column tooltip). The NL party mapping comes from the **EP Open Data Portal**
   (`NATIONAL_POLITICAL_GROUP` membership; HowTheyVote lacks it) — a static map topped up on a WARN.
   This surfaces where a Dutch party diverges from its Euro-group (e.g. PVV abstaining on a vote PfE
   carried). Same vote set and tier (A) as the group view.

### Eerste Kamer — tier B (faction-level, but both sides stated)
The Senate has **no machine API** (see [data-sources.md](data-sources.md) §9); we parse the per-fractie
voor/tegen lists embedded in the "stemmingen per vergaderdag" HTML pages. More reliable than NH (both
sides are named, so nothing is inferred), but less than the tier-A sources (no seat counts).
1. **No exact counts.** The EK votes *bij zitten en opstaan* — only a per-fractie voor/tegen, no
   tallies. Stored `1–0`; the UI reads `granularity: "fractie"` and hides "ruwe getallen". Agreement %s
   weight every fractie equally (not by zetels).
2. **Both sides named — no "overige fracties" inference** (unlike NH). The voor and tegen fractie lists
   are published in full, so the matrix is read directly, not computed.
3. **Hamerstukken are excluded.** Items passed *zonder stemming* (hamerstuk) carry no voor/tegen
   breakdown (only an optional "aantekening gevraagd") and are skipped — consistent with keeping only
   real roll-calls (as for the TK). So the dataset is the **contested** votes, incl. **verworpen**.
4. **Hoofdelijke (per-member) votes are aggregated to the fractie.** Those rare votes list individual
   senators (`Naam (Fractie)`); we roll them up to the fractie (a fractie split across members → O +
   split). Member-level counts are not retained (faction-level by design).
5. **Splinter fracties** (Fractie-Beukering, -Van de Sanden, -Visseren-Hamakers, -Walenkamp, -Kemperman,
   -Van Gasteren) appear as their own columns when named; one-member references ("het lid X") are merged
   into the matching fractie. **Term:** one scope per EK, current (installed 13 June 2023) plus
   **2019–2023** and **2015–2019**. The site's stemmingen archive only reaches ~mid-2015, so older EK
   terms aren't served as data (see *Historische termijnen*). The EK term differs from the TK term.

### Utrecht — tier A
- The dataset mirrors the GO stemgedrag module. The main residual risk is upstream: if a vote was
  mis-recorded in the source, we faithfully reproduce it. Dates are resolved via `meetingId`.
- Practically nothing is inferred on our side.

### Drenthe — tier A
- Same GO stemgedrag module and adapter as Utrecht, so the same "mirrors the source, nothing inferred"
  guarantee holds — reached via the `/Leden/{slug}/votings` path (Utrecht uses `/Samenstelling/...`;
  see data-sources.md §2b). Per-member voor/tegen counts, incl. verworpen. Added 2026-07-05.
- Type labels: Drenthe titles its statenvoorstellen "Statenstuk YYYY-NN; …" → classified as *besluit*
  (added to the shared `classify()`). Moties/amendementen use "M …"/"A …" codes with the words spelled
  out. One item (0.2%) stays *overig* — a source typo ("Staenstuk", missing a t) not worth special-casing.
- Column universe: only groups typed `Fractie` in the GO `groups` API that actually cast votes appear;
  the role-typed pseudo-fracties (Voorzitter, Gedeputeerde, …) drop out for want of votings data.

### Limburg — tier A
- The "Stemmen" field lists each fractie with its member count on the voor and tegen sides, so
  counts and splits are exact (27 in-term moties have a real fractie split). **Includes verworpen**
  moties and amendementen — the only iBabs province so far with rejected items.
- The one gap: moties/amendementen decided **without a hoofdelijke stemming** (bij acclamatie /
  handopsteken) carry no per-fractie tally and are skipped. In practice this only drops the
  ingetrokken/aangehouden items; essentially all *decided* moties have a recorded breakdown.
- Local fracties (LOKAAL-LIMBURG, Horizon, oos limburg, SVL) pass through un-aliased.

### Zuid-Holland, Fryslân, Gelderland, Overijssel (Notubiz) — tier A
The four Notubiz provinces share one adapter (`collect_notubiz`); see [data-sources.md](data-sources.md)
§11. No API token is needed: the public events + votings API (`version=1.21`) discovers the plenary
meetings and gives each stemming's title/result, and the public **portal** vergadering page carries the
per-fractie breakdown with exact member counts.
1. **Exact per-member counts.** The portal lists each fractie with its members tagged voor/against; we
   count them, so tallies and intra-fractie splits are real — `granularity: "member"`. The `chart_<id>`
   div joins 1:1 to the votings API `id`, and we **cross-check** every parsed total against the API's
   own per-member votes (the collector WARNs on any mismatch; none in the current data).
2. **Includes verworpen** (and the occasional *staken van stemmen* → tie). The dataset is the items
   that went to a **hoofdelijke stemming**.
3. **Items without a roll-call are skipped.** Agenda votings decided *bij acclamatie* / without a
   recorded hoofdelijke stemming carry no per-fractie breakdown (the API returns them with no votes and
   no result) and drop out — consistent with Limburg/EK. Members who didn't take part in a stemming
   aren't in its tally.
4. **Item type** comes from the API's `voting_type` (motion/amendment/council_proposal) where present,
   else from the title's code prefix — which differs per province ("M 1567"/"A 873"/"SV …" ZH,
   "26M45" Gelderland, "PS26-M52"/"PS26-MV9" Overijssel) or Frisian on Fryslân ("Moasje"/"Amendemint").
5. **Mid-term composition.** Spelling variants / pure renames are merged into one column (ZH:
   GroenLinks-PvdA ↔ "PRO"; "Partij voor de Dieren" ↔ "PvdD"); fracties that genuinely existed
   separately before a merger are kept separate. One-person afsplitsingen are their own named columns
   (Fryslân "Steatelid Van Dijk"/"Jonker", Gelderland "Groep Roerdink"/"Claassen"); a non-fractie label
   ("Geen partij" — a member mid-afsplitsing with no fractie yet) is dropped, not shown as a party.
6. **Coverage starts when the portal does.** Gelderland's published votings begin 2024-01-31 (no
   per-fractie charts for its 2023 plenary meetings); the others reach back to term start (April 2023).
7. **Personal data.** Votes are recorded per member, but the dataset is kept **party-level** (member
   names are not stored) — consistent with the v1 privacy stance.

### Noord-Holland — tier B
Reliable for the headline question ("did fractie X vote voor or tegen this adopted motie?"), but
know these limits before trusting an exact figure:
1. **No exact counts.** Votes are stored `1–0` per fractie. The UI reads `meta.granularity:
   "fractie"` and **hides the "ruwe getallen" toggle** (and describes cells in words, not "1 voor
   0 tegen") so the missing counts aren't shown as if real. Agreement %s weight every fractie
   equally (not by zetels).
2. **"Overige fracties" is inferred, not stated.** The losing side is named; the winning side is
   "overige fracties", which we expand against a *computed* party universe (built from the data)
   minus afwezig/split, with a `first_seen` gate for mid-term splinters. This is the layer most
   likely to hide a subtle error — it's an assumption about who was in the room.
3. **Free-text parsing.** Stemverhouding is inconsistent prose (glued labels, stray spaces,
   "Verdeeld gestemd:" clauses). The parser handles every form seen so far; a *novel* phrasing
   could be mis-read or skipped (the collector logs "no parseable vote" counts — watch them).
4. **Splits/abstentions are lossy.** A split shows only when the portal writes "Verdeeld gestemd";
   abstentions aren't represented at fractie level.
5. **Adopted only.** The iBabs registers track *aangenomen* moties/amendementen — **verworpen items
   are absent entirely** (not published per-fractie anywhere on the portal; see the gap below).

## Known gaps to revisit
- **Niet-aangenomen items (some iBabs provinces).** Limburg publishes verworpen items; **Noord-Holland
  does not** (its registers are adopted-only — rejected ones live only in besluitenlijst/notulen PDFs).
  So the gap is portal-specific, not vendor-wide.
- **Faction-level provinces lose "ruwe getallen" / exact splits** — inherent to iBabs *free-text*
  provinces (NH). The Notubiz provinces are the opposite: per-member counts, so tier A.
- **The three not-live provinces publish votes only as PDF (probed 2026-07-05/06, corrects earlier "dead
  end" wording).** **Zeeland**'s structured Stemming/Moties/Amendementen reports are empty (incl. the
  `Stemmen` field — re-checked 2026-07-06), but its **concept-besluitenlijst** PDF names the voting fracties
  per item. **Groningen**'s Notubiz votings API is empty and the portal pages carry no per-fractie markup
  (re-probed 2026-07-06), but its **Handelingen** name both sides + totals. **Flevoland** (GO) is the
  griffie-lobby case. None is a data-absence dead end — the votes are recorded and public, just not
  machine-readable → publish-as-data lobby (see [outreach.md](outreach.md) §3), with fragile PDF-parsing as
  a fallback. *(Noord-Brabant was on this list until 2026-07-06 — turned out its votes were in the iBabs
  `Stemmen` field all along, so it's now live tier A, not a PDF case.)*
- **Spot-checking.** Tier-B data isn't self-verifying; eyeball a few moties against the portal after
  big parser changes. Method per source is in [data-sources.md](data-sources.md).
